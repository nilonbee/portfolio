### For Deployment follow this procedure if you are getting errors...

### 1. Run yarn dev in your project folder.
### 2. Then run terminal as administrator and cd to your project folder then run vercel build command.
### 3. After it finished successfully , delete the folder inside .vercel\output\functions\next\data
### 4. Then run vercel deploy prebuilt -> successful
### (It worked for me)
